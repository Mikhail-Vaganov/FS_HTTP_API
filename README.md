# FS_HTTP_API
The test task

The project represents the backend part of a File store server.
HTTP API allows users to manage their files, namely:

1. Read the list of files in a working directory.
2. Retrieve a file stored on the server.
3. Upload a file on the server using PUT or POST HTTP methods.
4. Update a file on the server.
5. Get meta data of a file.

The path for file managing requests is fsapi/files.
The main request parameter is the file_name.
